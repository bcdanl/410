## 🌍 Overview

In **DANL 410: Data Analytics Capstone**, you will complete an end-to-end analytics project—starting from a focused question, moving through data work and analysis, and ending with a polished report and presentation.

This course is designed to help you practice what data analysts actually do:

- Translate a real-world problem into an analytics question
- Find and evaluate data (or create a clean dataset)
- Clean, transform, and explore the data
- Apply an appropriate **machine learning or statistical method** (e.g., regression, classification, clustering)
- Communicate findings clearly with visuals and writing
- Publish your work on your **Quarto website** (GitHub Pages)

::: callout-note
You do **not** need the “perfect” topic at the beginning.
Your goal early in the semester is to build a **feasible plan** with a clear question, a credible dataset, and a reasonable method.
:::

### 👥 Team Formation

- Each team may have **one or two members**.
- Every team member is expected to contribute actively and understand the entire project.
- Teams should be formed by **Wednesday, Feb 11, 11:59 P.M.**
- If your team has two members, a representative should email Prof. Choe at <bchoe@geneseo.edu>, **cc-ing a team member**.

## 🧾 Research Kick-off Report — Structure

Your **Research Kick-off Report** (2–3 pages) is a concise proposal that explains:

- **what** you plan to study,
- **why** it matters (business, social, or policy relevance),
- **how** you will study it using data.

Include these sections:

1. **Working Title & Topic**
   - A clear, descriptive title.
   - 2–4 sentences describing the topic and setting.

2. **Research Question**
   - State one main research question in a single sentence.
   - Add 1–3 sub-questions if helpful.

3. **Motivation / Value**
   - Why would someone care?
   - Who is the “stakeholder” (a business, customers, local government, nonprofit, campus office, etc.)?
   - What decision, insight, or understanding might the analysis support?

4. **Data Plan**
   - What dataset(s) will you use?
   - Unit of analysis (customer? county? day? product? student? transaction?)
   - Key variables you expect to use (inputs and outcomes)
   - Data limitations you already anticipate (missingness, small sample, measurement, bias)

5. **Method Plan (Required: include one ML/statistical component)**
   - What approach will you use and why?
   - Examples:
     - Regression (prediction or cause-and-effect)
     - Classification (e.g., churn / pass-fail / fraud / sentiment categories)
     - Clustering (e.g., segmentation)
     - Time-series forecasting (if appropriate)
   - What is your evaluation plan? (train/test split, accuracy/RMSE, cross-validation, or a clear validation idea)

6. **References**
   - Use a consistent citation style.
   - For online sources: include **URL** and **date of access**.

::: callout-note
💡 Think of the Kick-off Report as your **project blueprint**.
You are not expected to have final results yet—but your plan should be **credible and feasible**.

## 💡 Brainstorming Ideas (Capstone-Friendly)

| Area | Example Research Question | Data Type | Possible Methods |
|---|---|---|---|
| Business / Marketing | Which factors predict customer churn or repeat purchase? | transactions, CRM, reviews | classification, regression |
| Operations | What drives delays or failures in a process? | timestamps, logs | regression, clustering |
| Finance / Risk | Can we predict risk outcomes or identify risky segments? | firm/household indicators | classification, clustering |
| Sports / Performance | Which player/team features predict win probability? | game logs | regression, classification |
| Public Policy | Which communities face higher risk or lower access? | census + admin data | regression, mapping, clustering |
| Education | What predicts course performance or retention patterns? | LMS / grades / surveys | regression, classification |
| Climate Change | Which factors predict household solar adoption (or energy burden) across counties? | American Community Survey (ACS) + solar installs + weather/energy | regression, classification, mapping |

## 🧭 Research Idea Logic

A strong capstone topic is:

- **Specific enough** to answer within one semester  
- **Data-supported** (you can actually obtain usable data)  
- **Method-feasible** (you can execute and interpret a reasonable model)  
- **Meaningful** (it has a real stakeholder, decision, or insight)

Think in “question types”:

| Type | Purpose | Example |
|---|---|---|
| **Descriptive** | Summarize what is happening | “How have housing prices changed across counties since 2018?” |
| **Comparative** | Compare groups or time periods | “Do outcomes differ by region, income level, or policy change?” |
| **Predictive** | Predict an outcome using features | “Can we predict churn using usage behavior?” |
| **Segmentation** | Identify clusters / groups | “Can we cluster customers into meaningful segments?” |
| **Diagnostic** | Identify drivers of an outcome | “Which factors are most associated with delays?” |

::: callout-warning
Avoid questions that are too broad:

- “How does social media affect society?”

Instead, narrow:

- “Which post features predict higher engagement for a specific account/category?”

### 💾 Using Data Effectively

You are encouraged to use **real-world data** and present evidence using:

- Clean tables (summary statistics, grouped means, counts)
- Clear visualizations (distributions, trends, comparisons, relationships)
- A method you can explain and justify
- Transparent code and reproducible workflow

**Guidelines:**

- Start with a dataset you can actually obtain **quickly** (Week 2–4).
- Prefer data that has:
  - Enough observations to learn patterns
  - Clear variable definitions
  - A usable target/outcome variable (for prediction/classification), or a clear grouping structure (for clustering)
- Use modeling only when it adds value:
  - A “fancy” model with weak interpretation is worse than a simple model well explained.
- Always cite data sources and document data cleaning steps.

::: callout-tip
You don’t need complex modeling to do a strong capstone—
but you *do* need **clear evidence + clear reasoning + clear communication**.

## 🌟 Closing Thought

> A strong capstone project is not about doing *everything*—  
> it’s about doing a **focused** analysis **well**,  
> and communicating results clearly enough that someone can act on them.
