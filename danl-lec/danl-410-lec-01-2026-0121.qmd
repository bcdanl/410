## What this course is about

DANL 410 is an **individualized capstone experience** where each student completes an end-to-end analytics project in an area of their interest.

Your project may focus on:

- a disciplinary topic (inside or outside the School of Business), **or**
- an external organization / stakeholder problem

## Key skills you’ll build:

- Formulate a focused capstone question grounded in stakeholder needs  
- Design and execute a complete analytics pipeline (proposal → final deliverables)  
- Apply appropriate methods (regression, classification, clustering, inference, etc.)  
- Create publication-quality visualizations and analytical outputs  
- Use reproducible workflows (well-documented code, transparent process)  
- Communicate results for technical and non-technical audiences  


## Prerequisites

## Course Policies

- **Late work:** Reports are accepted up to **3 days late** with a **30% penalty**.
- **Attendance:** Attendance is taken using a **sign-in sheet** on days when a lecture is scheduled.  
  - You are expected to attend class on lecture days.  
  - You have **3 unexcused absences** available during the semester.  
    - Beyond that, your total percentage grade may be reduced.  
  - On days when a lecture is **not** scheduled, attendance is **not required**.  
    - However, I strongly encourage you to attend and use the class time to work on your project.  
    - You can also use this time to ask the instructor questions and get feedback.


## Academic integrity & AI use

- Cheating and plagiarism violate college policy and may result in serious consequences.
- You **may use AI tools** (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) to support your learning, **but** you must:
  - **Disclose** AI use when it meaningfully contributes to your work  
  - **Cite/attribute** AI-generated material appropriately  
  - Using AI **without disclosure/citation** may be treated as academic dishonesty
- There is **no penalty** for using AI on Homework and the Data Storytelling Project.
  - However, you are still responsible for understanding, verifying, and being able to explain any AI-assisted work.
