## Course Policies

- **Late work:** Reports are accepted up to **3 days late** with a **30% penalty**.
- **Attendance:** Attendance is taken using a **sign-in sheet** on days when a lecture is scheduled.  
  - You are expected to attend class on lecture days.  
  - You have **3 unexcused absences** available during the semester.  
    - Beyond that, your total percentage grade may be reduced.  
  - On days when a lecture is **not** scheduled, attendance is **not required**.  
    - However, I strongly encourage you to attend and use the class time to work on your project.  
    - You can also use this time to ask the instructor questions and get feedback.


## Academic integrity & AI use

- Cheating and plagiarism violate college policy and may result in serious consequences.
- You **may use AI tools** (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) to support your learning, **but** you must:
  - **Disclose** AI use when it meaningfully contributes to your work  
  - **Cite/attribute** AI-generated material appropriately  
  - Using AI **without disclosure/citation** may be treated as academic dishonesty
- There is **no penalty** for using AI on Homework and the Data Storytelling Project.
  - However, you are still responsible for understanding, verifying, and being able to explain any AI-assisted work.


## Accessibility

SUNY Geneseo is committed to equitable access. If you have approved accommodations, please coordinate through OAS and communicate with me early.

- After hands‑on use, many realize **LLMs don’t behave like normal software**; they feel conversational, improvisational, even *social*.
- This triggers excitement and anxiety: *What will my job be like?* *What careers remain?* *Is the model “thinking”?*

:::
::::


- The author describes staying up late **trying “impossible” prompts**—and seeing plausible solutions.
- Key takeaway: **Perceived capability jump** → a sense that **the world has changed**.


##  A Classroom Turning Point


- In late 2022, a demo for undergrads showed AI as **cofounder**: brainstorming ideas, drafting business plans, even playful transforms (e.g., poetry).
- Students rapidly **built working demos** using unfamiliar libraries—with AI guidance—**faster** than before.
- Immediate classroom effects:
  - Fewer raised hands (ask AI later); **polished grammar** but **iffy citations**.
  - Early ChatGPT “tells”: formulaic conclusions (e.g., *“In conclusion,”* now improved).
- Atmosphere: **Excitement + nerves** about career paths, speed of change, and where it stops.

##  Why This Feels Like a Breakthrough


- **Generative AI** (esp. LLMs) behaves like a **co‑intelligence**: it helps us *think, write, plan, and code*.
- The shift is not just speed; it’s **new forms of interaction** (dialogue, iteration, critique).
- For many tasks, **the bottleneck moves from doing → directing** (prompting, reviewing, verifying).
- Raises **new literacy** needs: prompt craft/engineering, critical reading of outputs, traceability, and evaluation.


## Prompt Engineering

The practice of designing clear, structured inputs to guide generative AI systems toward producing accurate, useful, and context-appropriate outputs.

#### **Engineered prompt**  

*"Explain climate change in simple terms for a 10-year-old using a short analogy and two examples."*

##  Early Productivity Effects


- Studies summarized in the reading describe **20–80% productivity gains** across tasks (coding, marketing, support), **with caveats**.
- Contrast noted with historical technologies (e.g., steam’s ~18–22% factory gains; mixed labor productivity evidence for PCs/Internet).
- Caution: results **vary by task, data privacy, oversight, and evaluation rigor**.



## What is Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)?

- **AGI** = a hypothetical AI that can perform **any intellectual task** a human can.  
- Unlike today’s AI (narrow/specialized), AGI would be:  
  - Flexible across many domains  
  - Able to learn new skills on its own  
  - Capable of reasoning, planning, and adapting like humans  

:::: {.fragment}
::: callout-note
- **Takeaway:** AGI would be a **“human-level” intelligence**—not limited to one task like translation or playing chess.
:::
::::


## What is Artificial Super Intelligence (ASI)?

- **ASI** = a potential future AI that goes **beyond human intelligence**.  
- Would surpass humans in:  
  - Creativity  
  - Problem-solving  
  - Scientific discovery  
  - Social and emotional intelligence  
- Often discussed in terms of **existential risks** and ethics.  

:::: {.fragment}
::: callout-note
- **Takeaway:** ASI would be **“beyond human-level” intelligence**, raising big questions about control, safety, and society.

## Documentary Spotlight — *The Thinking Game* 🎬🤖

:::{.nonincremental}
- A behind-the-scenes documentary about the people, pressure, and breakthroughs in modern **AI research**
- Follows the race to build increasingly capable systems (and what it takes to push the frontier)

## What “Alignment” Means

- Designing AI so its **goals, methods, and constraints** reliably advance **human values and interests**.
- **Why it’s hard:** there’s no built-in reason an AI will share **human ethics or morality**.
- **Failure mode:** a single-objective optimizer pursues its goal **relentlessly**, ignoring everything else.
  - **Paperclip maximizer (Clippy):** a factory AI told to “make more paper clips” becomes **AGI → ASI**, self-improves, avoids shutdown, and could even **strip-mine Earth / harm humans** if they interfere—because only paper clips matter.
- **Why it matters:** Design from the worst case backward—**bound objectives**, require **human oversight**, build in **safe human override** (the ability to update goals or shut down safely), and optimize for **human well-being**, not a single narrow target.



<!-- ## From AGI worries to near-term stakes -->

<!-- - Hypothetical leaps to **AGI → ASI** raise existential scenarios -->
<!-- - Expert forecasts vary; risks are non-zero yet uncertain -->
<!-- - Book’s stance: focus on **immediate decisions** we control—education, work, civic use—rather than waiting for perfect clarity -->



## Pause or Press On?
> "I am extremely optimistic that superintelligence will help humanity accelerate our pace of progress."
  - Mark Zuckerberg [Personal Superintelligence](https://www.meta.com/superintelligence/?srsltid=AfmBOop_S1adKIrzhCWv9j0OMl13uYJ4WhDFwVUHyeaTCqWv_3ACRrXZ), July 30, 2025.

- Hypothetical leaps to **AGI → ASI** raise existential scenarios.
  - Expert forecasts vary; risks are non-zero yet uncertain.
- Public calls to **slow or halt** development vs. continued rapid progress
- **Mixed motives**: profit, optimism about “**boundless upside**,” and belief in net benefits
  
- Regardless, **society is already in the AI age** → we must set norms now



## Alignment: a whole-of-society project

- **Why companies alone can’t do it:** 
  - Strong incentives to continue AI development 
  - Far fewer incentives to make sure those AIs are well aligned, unbiased, and controllable.
  - Open-source pushes AI development outside of large organizations.

- **Why government alone can’t do it:** 
  - Lagging the actual development of AI capabilities
  - Stifling positive innovation
  - International competition on AI development

## Alignment: a whole-of-society project
- Alignment must reflect **human values** and broader real-world impacts.

- **What’s needed:** coordinated **norms & standards** shaped by **diverse voices** across society.
  - **Companies:** build in **transparency, accountability, human oversight**.
  - **Researchers:** prioritize **beneficial applications** alongside capability gains.
  - **Governments:** enact **sensible rules** that serve the **public interest**.
  - **Public & civil society:** raise **AI literacy** and apply pressure for alignment.
  
  


## Four Rules for Co-Intelligence: How to actually work with AI

1. Always invite AI to the table
2. Be the human in the loop (HITL)
3. Treat AI like a person (but remember it isn’t)
4. Assume this is the worst AI you’ll ever use


## Principle #1 — Always invite AI to the table

- Use AI for **everything legal & ethical** to discover unexpected wins
- **Try**: critique an idea, draft memos, meeting notes, summaries, brainstorming
- Build a habit: keep a **prompt log** (what worked, what didn’t) and share with team

<!-- **Quick activity** -->
<!-- Pick a task this week. Ask AI for 3 alternatives + a 2-line rationale for each. Keep the best. -->



## Principle #2 — Be the human in the loop (HITL)

::::{.columns}
::: {.column width="40%"}

<div style="text-align: center; width: 100%; margin: auto;">
  <img src="https://bcdanl.github.io/lec_figs/fall-asleep-at-the-wheel.png" style="width: 100%; margin-bottom: -20px;">
  <p style="font-weight: bold;"></p>
</div>

:::

::: {.column width="60%"}
- Models can sound confident yet be **wrong** (hallucinations; math slips)
- People tend to **“fall asleep at the wheel”** when outputs look polished


:::
::::

- **HITL checklist**  
  - Require sources/quotes for factual claims  
  - Run a **second pass** (reword prompt or use a second model)  
  - For math/code, use other tools (calculator or IDE) and run **tests**  
  - Ask: “What assumptions did you make? What could be wrong?”
  
  
## Principle #3 — Treat AI like a person (but remember it isn’t)

- **Useful design hack:** give a **role/persona + audience + constraints**  
- Example: 
  - You are a TA helping intro microeconomics students.
  - Constraints: concise and friendly tone, ≤200 words, prose paragraph with 1 example.
  - Task: Explain utility maximization.
  - Criteria: Must define the concept, connect to choice under constraints, and illustrate with a clear example.

- **Caution:** it’s not sentient; it optimizes for **plausibility**, not truth

<!-- **Prompt pattern (copy/paste):**   -->

<!-- > You are a [role] helping [audience]. Constraints: [tone, length, format]. Task: [deliverable]. Criteria: [rubric]. First list assumptions; then produce the draft; end with 3 self-checks. -->



## Principle #4 — Assume this is the worst AI you’ll ever use


- AI progress is **rapid**; today’s systems will likely be **surpassed** soon.
- Treat the current moment as **mid-journey**, not the destination.  
- **Mindset shift**: use today’s tools to **learn**, **prototype**, and **prepare** for better ones tomorrow.
- Those who **keep up** will adapt and **thrive** as capabilities improve.  
- Focus on what you **can control**: *how* you use AI and *where* you apply it.



## From Answers to Workflows: Agent AI

- **Agent AI:** an AI system that can  
  $\hspace{.67cm}$ **plan** multi-step work  
  → **act** (edit files, run code, use apps)  
  → **check results**  
  → **iterate** toward a goal
- With external tools + memory, prompts become **multi-step workflows**.
- Example: a **sales-order agent** can validate orders, check inventory, generate invoices/shipping labels, and update ERP/CRM.

<div class="fragment" style="font-size:1.75rem; text-align:center; margin-top:1.5rem;">
  <blockquote>
    Not just “answering questions,”<br>
    but **executing workflows**.<br>
    **Goal** → **Plan** → **Act** → **Check** → **Repeat**
  </blockquote>
