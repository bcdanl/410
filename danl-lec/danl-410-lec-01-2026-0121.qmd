## Instructor
### Economics and Data Science

- Choe, B.H., 2021. "**_Social Media Campaigns, Lobbying and Legislation: Evidence from #climatechange and Energy Lobbies._**"

- **Question**: To what extent do social media campaigns compete with fossil fuel lobbying on climate change legislation?

- Data include:
  - 5.0 million tweets with #climatechange/#globalwarming around the globe;
  - 12.0 million retweets/likes to those tweets;
  - 0.8 million Twitter users who wrote those tweets;
  - 1.4 million Twitter users who retweeted or liked those tweets;
  - 0.3 million US Twitter users with their location at a city level;
  - Firm-level lobbying data (expenses, targeted bills, etc.). 



## Instructor
### Economics and Data Science

- Choe, B.H. and Ore-Monago, T., 2024. "**_Governance and Climate Finance in the Developing World_**"

- **Climate finance** refers to the financial resources allocated for mitigating and adapting to climate change, including support for initiatives that reduce greenhouse gas emissions and enhance resilience to climate impacts.
  - We focus on *transnational financing* that rich countries provide poor countries with financial resources, in order to help them adapt to climate change and mitigate greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.
  - Since the GHG emissions in developing countries are rapidly growing, it is crucial to assess the effectiveness of climate finance.
  - Poor governance (e.g., legal system, rule of law, and accountability) can be significant barriers to emissions reductions.


## Instructor
### Economics and Data Science

- Choe, B.H. and Newbold, Steve, "**_Estimating the Value of Statistical Life (VSL) through Big Data_**"

- VSL is the monetary value associated with reducing the risk of death. 
  - How much value would that be? How can we measure it?
  - How do government agencies use the VSL to decide which policies are worth the cost when they reduce the risk of death?

### Grading

$$
\begin{align}
(\text{Total Percentage Grade}) =&\quad\;\; 0.05\times(\text{Attendance}) \notag\\
&\,+\, 0.05\times(\text{Quiz & Participation})\notag\\ 
& \,+\, 0.20\times(\text{Homework})\notag\\  
&\,+\, 0.20\times(\text{Presentation})\notag\\
& \,+\, 0.50\times(\text{Exam}).\notag
\end{align}
$$



## Syllabus
### Grading - Attendance & Homework

- You are allowed up to **4 absences in the MW course** and **6 absences in the MWF course** without penalty. 
  - Send me an email if you have standard excused reasons (illness, family emergency, transportation problems, etc.).

- For each absence beyond the initial four/six, there will be a deduction of 1% point from the Total Percentage Grade.

- The single lowest homework score will be dropped when calculating the total homework score. 
  - Each homework except for the homework with the lowest score accounts for 25% of the total homework score.



## Syllabus
### Grading - Midterm Exam Score

$$
\begin{align}
&(\text{Midterm Exam Score}) \\
=\, &\text{max}\,\left\{0.50\times(\text{Midterm Exam 1 Score}) \,+\, 0.50\times(\text{Midterm Exam 2 Score})\right.,\notag\\ 
&\qquad\;\,\left.0.33\times(\text{Midterm Exam 1 Score}) \,+\, 0.67\times(\text{Midterm Exam 2 Score})\right\}.\notag
\end{align}
$$

- The Midterm Exam Score is the maximum between 
  1. The simple average of the Midterm Exam 1 Score and the Midterm Exam 2 Score and
  2. The weighted average of them with one-third weight on the Midterm Exam 1 Score and two-third weight on the Midterm Exam 2 Score:
  
## Syllabus
### Grading - Total Exam Score

$$
\begin{align}
&(\text{Total Exam Score}) \\
=\, &\text{max}\,\left\{0.50\times(\text{Midterm Exam Score}) \,+\, 0.50\times(\text{Final Exam Score})\right.,\notag\\ 
&\qquad\;\,\left.0.25\times(\text{Midterm Exam Score}) \,+\, 0.75\times(\text{Final Exam Score})\right\}.\notag
\end{align}
$$

- The Total Exam score is the maximum between 
  1. The simple average of the Midterm Exam score and the Final Exam score and
  2. The weighted average of them with one-fourth weight on the Midterm Exam score and three-fourth weight on the Final Exam score:


## Syllabus
### Make-up Policy

-  Make-up exams will not be given unless you have either a medically verified excuse or an absence excused by the University.

- If you cannot take exams because of religious obligations, notify me by email at least two weeks in advance so that an alternative exam time may be set.

- A missed exam without an excused absence earns a grade of zero.

- Late submissions for homework assignment will be accepted with a penalty. 

- A zero will be recorded for a missed assignment.


## Syllabus
### Academic Integrity and Plagiarism

-  All homework assignments and exams must be the original work by you. 

- Examples of academic dishonesty include:
  - *Representing the work, thoughts, and ideas of another person as your own*
  - *Allowing others to represent your work, thoughts, or ideas as theirs*, and
  - *Being complicit in academic dishonesty by suspecting or knowing of it and not taking action*.


- Geneseo’s Library offers frequent workshops to help you understand how to **paraphrase**, **quote**, and **cite** outside sources properly. 
  - See [https://www.geneseo.edu/library/library-workshops](https://www.geneseo.edu/library/library-workshops){target="_blank"}.
 

## Syllabus
### Artificial Intelligence (AI) Policy

- Unless AI tools are explicitly permitted for homework, you must complete your work independently. 

- This means you should not use tools like ChatGPT for any aspect of our coursework. 

- Such use is a form of academic dishonesty. Use of such tools is not only cheating, it will also cheat you of the opportunity to learn and develop your own skills. 

- While AI will undoubtedly play important roles in our future society, you will be better able to utilize AI if you have developed your own critical thinking, writing, and analytical skills by doing your own work. 

- If you have any questions about this, please ask.



## Syllabus
### Accessibility

-  The Office of Accessibility will coordinate reasonable accommodations for persons with physical, emotional, or cognitive disabilities to ensure equal access to academic programs, activities, and services at Geneseo.

- Please contact me and the Office of Accessibility Services for questions related to access and accommodations.



## Syllabus
### Career Design

- To get information about career development, you can visit the Career Development Events Calendar ([https://www.geneseo.edu/career_development/events/calendar](https://www.geneseo.edu/career_development/events/calendar){target="_blank"}).

- You can stop by South 112 to get assistance in completing your Handshake Profile [https://app.joinhandshake.com/login](https://app.joinhandshake.com/login){target="_blank"}.
  - Handshake is ranked #1 by students as the best place to find full-time jobs.
  - 50% of the 2018-2020 graduates received a job or internship offer on Handshake.
  - Handshake is trusted by all 500 of the Fortune 500.

## Why Data Analytics?

- Fill in the gaps left by traditional business and economics classes.
  - Practical skills that will benefit your future career.
  - Neglected skills like how to actually find datasets in the wild and clean them.

- Data analytics skills are largely distinct from (and complementary to) the core quantitative works familiar to business undergrads.
  - Data visualization, cleaning and wrangling; databases; machine learning; etc.

- In short, we will cover things that I wish someone had taught me when I was undergraduate.

## Why Data Analytics?

- **Data analysts** use analytical tools and techniques to extract meaningful insights from data.
  - Skills in data analytics are also useful for **business analysts**, **market analysts**, **financial analysts**, **human resource analysts**, or **economists**.


- [Breau of Labor Statistics](https://www.bls.gov/ooh/math/data-scientists.htm){target="_blank"} forecasts that the projected growth rate of the employment in the industry related to data analytics from 2021 to 2031 is **36%**. 
  - The average growth rate for all occupations is **5%**.

## Data Analytics and Generative AI

- **Generative AI** refers to a category of AI that is capable of generating new content, ranging from text, images, and videos to music and code. 

:::{.incremental}

- In the early 2020s, advances in transformer-based deep neural networks enabled a number of generative AI systems notable for accepting natural language prompts as input.
  - These include large language model (LLM) chatbots (e.g., ChatGPT, Claude, Gemini, Copilot, Grok).

- **ChatGPT** (Chat Generative Pre-trained Transformer) is a chatbot developed by OpenAI and launched on November 30, 2022. 
  - By January 2023, it had become what was then the fastest-growing consumer software application in history.
