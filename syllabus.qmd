# Course Policies

## Late Work

Accepted up to **3 days late** with **30% penalty**.

## Make-up Work

Make-up exams will not be given unless you have either a medically verified excuse or an absence excused by the University.

If you cannot take exams because of religious obligations, notify me by email at least two weeks in advance so that an alternative exam time may be set.

A missed exam without an excused absence earns a grade of zero.

Late submissions for homework assignment will be accepted with a penalty. A zero will be recorded for a missed assignment.

## Attendance & Participation

The knowledge and skills you will gain in this course highly depend on your participation in class learning activities as an in-person class. Because of that, you are expected to attend all class sessions unless you are ill or have a valid reason for missing.

If you are sick or have another valid reason for missing, you must email me before the absence—any notifications after will be disregarded.

Attendance will be taken during class via a sign-up sheet. You must sign in to be credited for attending class. If you attend class and do not sign in, it will be considered the equivalent of an absence.

You are provided with **5 unexcused absences per semester**. Any additional unexcused absences will be subject to reducing **Total Percentage Grade by one percentage point** for each additional absence (6 total absences = 1% point (90 to 89), 7 total absences = 2% points (90 to 88), etc.).

For extended absences (i.e., more than a couple of days of classes), you should contact the Dean of Students, who can assist with contacting your faculty.

## Netiquette Policy

- Before contributing to a discussion board, verify if your question has already been asked and answered. Avoid repeating topics as you would in a real-life conversation.  
- Remain focused on the topic. Refrain from posting unrelated links, comments, thoughts, or images.  
- Avoid typing in all caps, as it may appear as if you're shouting.  
- Steer clear of writing anything that might be interpreted as angry or sarcastic, particularly as tone is hard to convey online.  
- Always use "Please" and "Thank you" when requesting assistance from peers or instructors.  
- Respect differing viewpoints. If disagreeing, do so respectfully and acknowledge the merits of your classmates' arguments.  
- Ensure accuracy when responding to a peer's query. If unsure, especially about deadlines, it's better not to guess to avoid confusion.  
- Be concise in your responses; lengthy replies to simple questions might not be read fully.  
- If multiple responses are received to your question, consider summarizing them for the benefit of the entire class.  
- Avoid derogatory comments or insulting others' intelligence. Disagree with ideas, not individuals.  
- When referencing a previous discussion, quote only the essential lines to provide context without requiring others to search for the original post.  
- Practice forgiveness. If a peer makes an error, do not dwell on it; everyone makes mistakes.  
- Before posting, run a spell and grammar check. This small effort can significantly impact how your message is perceived.  

# Accessibility Statement

SUNY Geneseo is dedicated to providing an equitable and inclusive educational experience for all students, which includes upholding the principles of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act (ADA). The Office of Accessibility (OAS) will coordinate reasonable accommodations for persons with disabilities to ensure equal access to academic programs, activities, and services offered by SUNY Geneseo.

Students with approved accommodations may submit a semester request to renew their academic accommodations. More information on the process for requesting academic accommodations is on the OAS website.

As a student in this course, it is important to recognize your role in ensuring that all classmates, including those who use assistive technologies, can fully engage with and comprehend the course content. Any digital materials you create and share, such as assignments, presentations, or shared documents, must be designed to be digitally accessible using the most up to date version of the WCAG 2.1 Level AA guidelines.

Accessible practices include, but are not limited to, providing alternative text for images, using clear heading structures, and ensuring captions for any video or audio you incorporate. Guidance in making your digital content accessible can be found on go.geneseo.edu/titleii.

# Religious Observations and Class Attendance

New York State Education Law 224-a stipulates that “any student in an institution of higher education who is unable, because of [their] religious beliefs, to attend classes on a particular day or days shall, because of such absence on the particular day or days, be excused from any examination or any study or work requirements” (see <https://www.geneseo.edu/apca/classroom-policies>).

SUNY Geneseo has a commitment to inclusion and belonging, and I want to stress my respect for the diverse identities and faith traditions of students in my class. If you anticipate an absence due to religious observations, please contact me as soon as possible in advance to discuss your needs and arrange make up plans.

The New York State Department of Civil Service maintains a calendar of major religious observations found on their website.

# Military Obligations and Class Attendance

Federal and New York State law requires institutions of higher education to provide an excused leave of absence from classes without penalty to students enrolled in the National Guard or armed forces reserves who are called to active duty.

If you are called to active military duty and need to miss classes, please let me know and consult as soon as possible with the Dean of Students.

# Academic Integrity and Plagiarism

Academic dishonesty includes cheating, knowingly providing false information, plagiarizing, and any other form of academic misrepresentation.

The School of Business regards all acts of cheating and/or plagiarism on tests or any other assignments as unprofessional and unethical behavior that violates College policies as stated in the Student Handbook. Students are expected to be aware of and to obey the College policies concerning academic dishonesty.

Any alleged cheating or plagiarism may be dealt with by the School as a disciplinary problem in accordance with College policies:

<https://www.geneseo.edu/handbook/academic-dishonesty-policy>

Plagiarism is the representation of someone else’s words or ideas as one’s own, or the arrangement of someone else’s material(s) as one’s own. In this course, such misrepresentation may be sufficient grounds for a student’s receiving a grade of E for the paper or presentation involved or may result in an E being assigned as the final grade for the course.

Any one of the following constitutes evidence of plagiarism:

- Direct quotation without identifying punctuation and citation of source  
- Paraphrase of expression or thought without proper attribution  
- Unacknowledged dependence upon a source in plan, organization, or argument  

# Use of AI in Coursework

This course encourages you to use Generative AI Tools like ChatGPT or Gemini to support your work. To maintain academic integrity, you must disclose and properly attribute any AI-generated material you use, including in-text citations, quotations, and references.

Guidance for citing AI-generated content is available at:

<https://apastyle.apa.org/blog/how-to-cite-chatgpt>

In cases where I discover the use of generative AI without proper citation, these cases will be treated as instances of academic dishonesty and will be subject to the processes outlined in the SUNY Geneseo Academic Dishonesty Policy.

**Generative AI Statement:** Use of generative AI tools (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini) must be disclosed and cited. Unauthorized use may violate academic integrity.
