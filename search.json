You must sign in to be credited for attending class. If you attend class and do not sign in, it will be considered the equivalent of an absence.\nYou are provided with 5 unexcused absences per semester. Any additional unexcused absences will be subject to reducing Total Percentage Grade by one percentage point for each additional absence (6 total absences = 1% point (90 to 89), 7 total absences = 2% points (90 to 88), etc.).\nFor extended absences (i.e., more than a couple of days of classes), you should contact the Dean of Students, who can assist with contacting your faculty."

Avoid repeating topics as you would in a real-life conversation.\n\nRemain focused on the topic. Refrain from posting unrelated links, comments, thoughts, or images.\n\nAvoid typing in all caps, as it may appear as if you’re shouting.\n\nSteer clear of writing anything that might be interpreted as angry or sarcastic, particularly as tone is hard to convey online.\n\nAlways use “Please” and “Thank you” when requesting assistance from peers or instructors.\n\nRespect differing viewpoints. If disagreeing, do so respectfully and acknowledge the merits of your classmates’ arguments.\n\nEnsure accuracy when responding to a peer’s query. If unsure, especially about deadlines, it’s better not to guess to avoid confusion.\n\nBe concise in your responses; lengthy replies to simple questions might not be read fully.\n\nIf multiple responses are received to your question, consider summarizing them for the benefit of the entire class.\n\nAvoid derogatory comments or insulting others’ intelligence. Disagree with ideas, not individuals.\n\nWhen referencing a previous discussion, quote only the essential lines to provide context without requiring others to search for the original post.\n\nPractice forgiveness. If a peer makes an error, do not dwell on it; everyone makes mistakes.\n\nBefore posting, run a spell and grammar check. This small effort can significantly impact how your message is perceived."

    "text": "🚫 What is a “Bad Control”?\nA bad control is a variable that:\n\nis influenced by the explanatory variable \\(x\\), or\nis part of the process that links \\(x\\) to the outcome \\(y\\)\n\nIncluding a bad control can “control away” the variation in \\(y\\) that is connected to \\(x\\), making the estimated relationship look smaller than it really is."
